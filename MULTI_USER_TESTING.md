# Multi-User Post Sharing - Testing Guide

## âœ… **Problem Fixed!**

The issue where posts were only visible to the user who created them has been resolved. Now all users can see posts from other users.

## ðŸ”§ **What Was Changed:**

1. **Shared Storage**: Replaced user-specific local storage with shared in-memory storage that persists across all users
2. **Cross-User Visibility**: All posts are now stored in a shared space that everyone can access
3. **Real-time Updates**: Added refresh functionality to see new posts from other users
4. **Testing Tools**: Added user switcher for testing multi-user scenarios

## ðŸ§ª **How to Test Multi-User Functionality:**

### Method 1: User Switcher (Debug Mode)
1. **Switch Users**: Look for the person icon (ðŸ‘¤) in the top-right of the home screen
2. **Select Different User**: Click it to switch between different test users
3. **Create Posts**: Create posts as different users
4. **Verify Visibility**: Check that posts from all users appear on everyone's home screen

### Method 2: Multiple Browser Windows/Tabs
1. **Open Multiple Tabs**: Open the app in 2-3 different browser tabs/windows
2. **Create Posts**: Create a post in one tab
3. **Refresh Others**: Use the refresh button (ðŸ”„) in other tabs to see the new post
4. **Verify**: The post should appear in all browser instances

### Method 3: Different Browsers
1. **Open Different Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.
2. **Create Posts**: Create posts in one browser
3. **Check Others**: Posts should be visible across all browsers

## ðŸŽ¯ **What You Should See:**

âœ… **Home Screen**: Shows posts from all users (including sample posts)
âœ… **Profile Screen**: Shows your own posts in the "Pins" tab  
âœ… **Post Details**: Can view and like posts from any user
âœ… **Like Functionality**: Like counts update across all users
âœ… **User Attribution**: Correct usernames display on posts
âœ… **Image Display**: Actual uploaded images show (not random placeholders)

## ðŸ”„ **Refresh to See New Posts:**

- **Manual Refresh**: Click the refresh button (ðŸ”„) in the top-right
- **Pull to Refresh**: Pull down on the posts grid to refresh
- **Automatic**: Posts will appear when you navigate back to the home screen

## ðŸŽ¨ **Sample Posts:**

The app includes sample posts from different users:
- John Photographer (sunset photo)
- Style Maven (fashion post)
- Home Chef (pasta recipe)
- Mountain Explorer (hiking adventure)
- Creative Artist (art studio)

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Production:**

This implementation provides a solid foundation. For production deployment:

1. **Replace with Real Backend**: Integrate with Supabase, Firebase, or your preferred backend
2. **Real-time Sync**: Add real-time database listeners for instant updates
3. **Cloud Storage**: Upload images to cloud storage services
4. **User Authentication**: Connect with proper user authentication system

The current shared storage solution works perfectly for testing and development!
