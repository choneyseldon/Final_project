# Font Placeholder Files

Since we can't download the actual font files in this environment, these are placeholder files.
In a real project, you would:

1. Go to Google Fonts (fonts.google.com)
2. Download Raleway font family (Regular, SemiBold, Bold)
3. Download Nunito font family (Regular, SemiBold, Bold)
4. Place the .ttf files in this fonts/ directory

For now, Flutter will fall back to the system default fonts.
